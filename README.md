# PHP Login Project
This is a basic login page I created to learn more about connecting with databases using PHP.
It's an extremely basic login setup and is intended for testing purposes only. It's not secure.

# How to install.
Place the project in your PHP environment with MYSQL enabled. Then run 'Login.php' with your browser.
